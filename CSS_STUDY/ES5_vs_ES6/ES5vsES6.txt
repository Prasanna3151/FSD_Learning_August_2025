1. 
Before ES6 only one variable was used all over javaScript. i.e. var
It has some problems. So, they introduced two new data types. let and const.
Compiler will declare all their var variables and functions in the global frame. 
let is also used to avoid re-declaration of previously used variables.

2. Template Literals:
These are used to print strings along with the resultant outputs.

syntax ex: 
console.log(`Happy Birthday, ${name}, you are now ${age} years old!`);

3. Array and Data destructuring:

example:
i. without destructuring:-
const meal = ["rice","sambar","rasam","kaarakolambu"];
let main = meal[0];
let side1 = meal[1];
let side2 = meal[2];
let side3 = meal[3];
console.log(main, side1,side2, side3);

const dosa = {type:"masala",spicy:true,count:3};
let type = dosa.type;
let spicy = dosa.spicy;
let count = dosa.count;
console.log(type,spicy,count);

ii. with destructuring:-
const meal = ["rice","sambar","rasam","kaarakolambu"];
const [main,side1,side2,side3] = meal;
console.log(main, side1,side2, side3);

const dosa = {type:"masala",spicy:true,count:3};
const {type,spicy,count} = dosa;
console.log(type,spicy,count);


4. Arrow function:

simplify the writing of function.
example: 
//traditional function:
let fName = "Prasanna";
let lName = "Sankar";
function fullName(fName,lName) {
    console.log(${fName}${lName});
}

//using arrow function:
let fName = "Prasanna";
let lName = "Sankar";
const fullName = (fName,lName) => {
    console.log(${fName}${lName});
}

5. Spread and Rest:
const ingredients = ['rice','dal','salt'];
const allIngredients = ['coconut','chillies', ...ingredients];
console.log(allIngredients);

const makeMeal = (main, ...sideDishes) => {
    console.log(${main}${sideDishes});
} 
makeMeal('dosa','sambar','chutney','chicken curry');
